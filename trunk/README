0. What is hpcviewer
----------------------------------------

hpcviewer is the presentation layer of HPCToolkit which is a suite of tools
for measurement and analysis of program performance.
hpcviewer contains three plug-in projects:

 edu.rice.cs.hpc.data (hpcdata)
 edu.rice.cs.hpc.viewer (hpcviewer)
 edu.rice.cs.hpc.traceviewer (hpctraceviewer)

hpcdata is the command line version of hpcviewer which is used to read the
database generated by hpcprof (or hpcprof-mpi) into an XML file format.
hpcviewer is a GUI tool to present profile data and hpctraceviewer is 
the presentation layer to display trace data.

=============================================================================

----------------------------------------
1. Obtaining and Installing hpcviewer
----------------------------------------

Download required software:

    * Eclipse at least 3.6 (Helios) version
          o RCP package is necessary  
    * Either subclipse or subversive (recommended):
          o Subclipse (ver. 1.6 or above) depending the subversion client version
          o Subversive 
    * Java JDK (ver 1.5 or above). SUN or IBM JDK is recommended


Install Eclipse subversion subclipse (or subversive):
    o (If you use subclipse, see the subclipse installation website for more details)
    o Go to *Help - Software updates - Find and Install*
    o Choose *Search for new features to install*, then click Next
    o Click *New remote site*, and set the URL as http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x
    o Go *Next*, then confirm the license aggreement and click *Finish*. 

Check out the source code

    * select File - New - Project menu
    * Select "Project from SVN"
    * Check out from: 

	 https://outreach.scidac.gov/svn/hpcviewer/trunk

    * When the window "Check out as" appears, check the option "Find projects in the children of the selected resource"
    * Make sure all three projects are selected: 

    edu.rice.cs.hpc.data 
    edu.rice.cs.hpc.viewer 
    edu.rice.cs.hpc.traceviewer 

Now, change the perspective into Java perspective to see the source code and launch the application.

Testing hpcviewer
================

Under edu.rice.cs.hpc.viewer project, launching the application from Eclipse can be done either via

    * plugin.xml
          o plugin.xml: go to "Overview" tab, and click "Launch an Eclipse application" 
    * product configurations (recommeded):
          o First, select hpcviewer.product file
          o Then, click "Launch an Eclipse application" 

Exporting hpcviewer
================

    * Under edu.rice.cs.hpc.viewer project, open the product configuration: hpcviewer.product
    * Fill the Root directory and Destination directory fields, then click Finish 


Installing hpcviewer
===================

Once hpcviewer has been exported successfully, we need to prepare a distribution package of hpcviewer:
   * In the command line, go to script directory
   * Run makedist shell script. The script will generate hpcviewer.tar.gz package file ready to install
   * Copy hpcviewer.tar.gz file into the machine to be installed
	scp hpcviewer.tar.gz your_account@machine:
   * uncompress the tar file 
	tar xzf hpcviewer.tar.gz
   * run install script:
	install [hpctoolkit_installation_directory]


=============================================================================

----------------------------------------
2. Building hpcdata
----------------------------------------

To build the jar file (and the launch script), you need either Eclipse or Apache Ant tool (recommended). To build with Apache Ant tool, you just need to go to the script directory:

cd edu.rice.cs.hpc.data/script

then launch the build script with Ant tool:

ant -buildfile hpcdata.xml

This process creates "hpcdata.zip" file which contains hpcdata.jar (the bytecodes), required libraries and the launch script (hpcdata.sh). Once you unzip the file, you can run the launch script:

sh hpcdata.sh [-o output_file] database_directory

Currently we only provide the launch script for Linux/Unix/Mac OSX. Adopting the launch script for Windows platform should be trivial.



=============================================================================

----------------------------------------
3. Building hpctraceviewer
----------------------------------------

Similar to hpcviewer, to launch hpctraceviewer via Eclipse, you need to:

  * select edu.rice.cs.hpc.traceviewer project
  * open hpctraceviewer.product file
  * click Launch Eclipse application

Similar procedures also applly to export and install hpctraceviewer.
